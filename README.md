# VargasIvan_Harvard-CS50W
This repository hosts my projects for CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript, an online course offered by Harvard. Each project showcases concepts from the course, including both front-end and back-end development, as I work through building practical web applications and advancing my skills in modern web technologies.
